When attempting to access the app known as Mindful it is impertive that you run the most up to date version of Xcode along with the most up to date version of apple's simulator. In order to properly view and grade my final project one should download the "Mindful" code onto their own Xcode, then once downloaded the user should open the project by double-clicking on the file. Then the user should navigate to the left side of the screen, opening the navigation by clicking the navigator icon in the top left. The user should see a number of icons across the top appear, the user should navigate to the file tab. Then, the user should open the file navigator for "Mindful" byr clicking on the app stor icon labeled "Mindful". Once the drop down menu is open, the user should double click on the file labeled as "Main". The user should then click the navigaton icon again to close the tabe bar. Then from there the user should see a nav bar towards the bottom left of the storybard window (bordering the different views). From there the user should click on the Iphone icon and select the "Iphone 14 pro" option. Then the user should run the simulator of the app by clicking on the play arrow in the top left of the Xcode screen. From there the user will be automatically directed to the simulator. If that is not the case the user can navigate towards their simulator through their downloaded apps. If neither of those work and the simulator is not running, the user can go back to the Xcode and click on the "Stop" (square) icon in the top left, and then the user should retstart the simulator by reiteratting through the steps before. 

Once the app is running the user can see usability/instructions for the different feature below:
